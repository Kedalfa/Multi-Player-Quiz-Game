# Multiplayer Online Quiz Game

## Project Overview
A modern, user-friendly Multiplayer Online Quiz Game built for university advanced programming coursework. This project demonstrates four core advanced programming concepts: **database**, **file handling**, **threading**, and **socket programming**. Multiple users can log in, join a real-time multiplayer lobby, chat, and compete in quiz matches. The game uses sockets for real-time communication and supports running multiple app instances on the same computer.

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
```
git clone https://github.com/Kedalfa/Multi-Player-Quiz-Game.git
```

### 2. Set Up the Database
- Import the provided SQL file (`quizgame.sql`) into your MySQL server.
- Update the database connection settings in `src/db/DBConnection.java` if needed (username, password).


### 3. Run the Server

### 4. Run the Application (Client)

### 5. Log In as Different Users
- Register or log in with different usernames in each app window.

### 6. Open the Multiplayer Window
- Click the "Multiplayer Quiz" button in the dashboard.
- You will see a list of online users in real time.
- If no users are online, a message will appear.

### 9. Start a Quiz Match
- You can start a quiz match and compete with other users.

## How to Test Multiplayer
- Open two (or more) app windows by running the client command multiple times.
- Log in as different users in each window.
- Open the multiplayer window in each app.
- You should see all logged-in users in the online users list.
- This works even if all app windows are on the same computer (using `localhost`).
